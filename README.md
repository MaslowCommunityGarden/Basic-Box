# Basic-Box


This is a remix of: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3238988 but in normal fashion, Thingiverse can't find any results searching in the remix source files box.....

I liked the above design, but wanted something cheaper that 10 or more of those containers. I also have a Maslow CNC so I decided to combine the printed parts from above with an MDF box I cut.

I used 0.093" thickness Lexan sheet for the front window. You can see I designed in a recess for it in the front panel, and I used silicone to glue it in after painting the box. 

I picked up some cheap window weatherstrip at Lowes to seal the top. 

The top is a basic rectangle I cut on the table saw, dimensions should be easily measured after the box is assembled.

I used silica packets from Amazon to aid in moisture protection: https://www.amazon.com/6PACKS-Rechargeable-Desiccant-Packets-indicating/dp/B0781BN1BZ

I used some basic hinges and latches from the hardware store too. 

There is also a thread pertaining to this design over at: https://forums.maslowcnc.com/t/just-a-basic-box/15940
